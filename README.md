# ImageProcessing
Use Processing with image processing. [Processing](http://processing.org) is a simple yet powerful library / framework to work with images using Java. In this repo Processing is used mainly to create a number of popular image processing effects ( considering that it can be used in a great many of other ways ).

## Structure
As a [Processing](http://processing.org) project, the files in this repo should be places under a folder named *ImageProcessing*, and then dbl-click ImageProcessing.pde to open the whole project.
The files described in the **Files** section together forms a simple GUI framework, while classes that implement the *Entry* interface mainly create the effects.

## Files
* **ImageProcessing.pde**: The program entry, passes its events on to **UIManager.pde**.
* **UIManager.pde**: Respond to the events and provide a widgets management which allows users to have a simple GUI and control the image. It can be removed completely by moving the code to **ImageProcessing.pde**, however that will make it difficult to rename the project, as there would be so many names to modify.
* **Entry.pde**: Interface that describes an entry of an effect. Notice that there should be only one effect running at the same time.
* **Mouse.pde**: Translator from *Processing Input Model* to the *Java Event Model*. ( okay just for fun ï¼‰
* **Registry.pde**: Stores all the **Entries** and enables querying any one of them using a String key. ( well not so useful, it only saves me the effort to delete the code that initializes the other effects when I'm adding a new one )
* **Widget.pde**: Contain interface **Widget** and implementations like **CheckWidget** and **RadioWidget** which represents the good-old checkbox and radiobox. **Widgets** are used as a simple GUI and work just like those we see on our computers every day.

## Images
There's no doubt that a image processing program needs images as input. There are some images in the repo for testing of my effects.
You can also copy your own images to the folder and modify **ImageProcessing.pde** to watch the effects casted on them.
I decided not to describe the images a lot, only a few brief words. Some are photos of some *famous people* and others are down-samples of some pictures of mine.
btw *faster-than-anyone.png* is Chinese. Sorry.

## Effects ( under active development )
* Mosaic ( **EntryMosaic.pde** ): The mosaic effect, generate a grid of shapes according to the color / grayscale of the corresponding point in the image. Can resize shapes using brightness and apply a fade-out effect. Shapes can be circular or rectangular.
* Halftone ( **EntryHalftone.pde** ): The halftone effect, has modes that generate points along a rectangular grid or a set of concentric circles ( like in Adobe Photoshop ). Points can be circles or quads, and colors are sampled from either the original image or the grayscale image. ( effect actually look brighter than original 'cause the points are resized according to the brightness of the sampled point, so that's double brighter ). There's another wonderful effect under **EntryHalftone**, called *scatter* ( run the program and you'll see ). It actually works like a low-res image printed on a newspaper: the four basic types of ink ( black, magenta, cyan, yellow ) together forms the actual image. I found out that if I draw the four types of pointes with the same rotation angle the effect looks just like the *grid* version, however if I rotate each type a bit the effect would be awesome: under such a low resolution like this it can express such a exquisite final output. It's just kinda cool.
* Circles ( **EntryCircles.pde** ): Forgive me for calling it in such a funny way, it's just I can't figure out a better name, or would anybody help me? Anyway, this effect generated shapes in different sizes and try to make them look like a black-or-white image together. Unfortunately there're a few parameters in the program that must be artifucially adjusted for the best effect according to the image. The ones in the code works on *faster-than-anyone.png*. Shapes can be circles, quads, hexagons or texts. You can modify the text content ( currently letters of "SIMPLE" ) and font ( currently "DIN Black", in case you have had it installed ).

## Others
This projects runs under Processing 3.0.2.
